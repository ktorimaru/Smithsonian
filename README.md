# Smithsonian

## IOS Application Test

You are welcome to complete all of the features. Since it is a limited amount of
time we would rather see one of the pieces really well done than everything half
way.

Some things we are looking at:
* Architecture/Patterns
* Flow of control/data
* Testable code

What you will need to do:

Create a mobile application connected to the Smithsonian open data api!
  https://edan.si.edu/openaccess/apidocs/UI/API

The application will do a category search from the api and show a paginated
side scrolling view:

Each view in list should have:
* thumbnail image displayed
* the title as a label
* data_source as a label
* Tapping on a view opens a separate view with the same data.

### Persistance

Previous results should be available between app starts. So please save results
somehow.

Core data can be used here in a pattern to decouple API from UI.
You are welcome to use any libraries or patterns you feel most comfortable with.
If you have any questions please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out.

### Submission

Please send a GitHub link to your repository where the app is or send a zipped
version of the code.
